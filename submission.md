Submit
frak\ture is again OPEN for submissions!
Send submissions to slushpuppy [at] frakturejournal.org.

We accept you as you are,
but not your work:  

Poetry only
No previously published work, simultaneous submissions ok
PDF files only, up to 3 poems in one PDF
Only one submission per reading period
Include short, third-person biographical information in the email, not the attached PDF
Note:

Poems from 3 to 100 lines have the best chance of acceptance
Chapbook-length manuscripts will be promptly shot on sight (STAY OFF MY LAWN!)
We call dibs on first publication. Until then, author’s rights ride shotgun.
Proper submissions should never submit and must always mix mazel tov with molotov.
